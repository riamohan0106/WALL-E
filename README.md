# WALL-E
A chatbot is artificial intelligence (AI) software that can simulate a conversation (or 
a chat) with a user in natural language through messaging applications, websites, 
and mobile apps or through the telephone. An AI chatbot can understand language 
outside of a set of pre-programmed commands and continue learning based on 
the inputs it receives. They can also make changes based on patterns and become 
smarter over time as they experience new situations. This type of chatbot can be 
applied to a range of uses â€“ from sentiment analysis to making predictions about 
what a visitor is looking for on your website.
SCRIPTED CHATBOTS: Conversations with this type of chatbot can only follow a 
predetermined path. At each step in the conversation the user will need to pick 
from explicit options to determine the next step of the conversation. How the 
options are presented to the user at each step of the conversation. The following 
are some examples of chatbot applications out of the infinite possibilities: A 
takeaway restaurant allowing customers to order from a chatbot, either in the 
store or at home. A sit down restaurant allowing customers to order food from 
their table using a chatbot. 
This project is however also to try and show its (Wall-E) unique deployment 
method and how an interactive website can be created. The concepts of web 
designing and programming have been used to make it as creative as possible
